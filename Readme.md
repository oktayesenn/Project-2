# Unit Project: Tailwind Multi-Page Showcase

## Overview
Create a five-page mini site powered by Tailwind CSS. Each page highlights a topic of your choice (movies, cartoons, boroughs, countries, music, travel, etc.) and demonstrates purposeful use of semantic HTML and responsive layouts.

## Deliverables
- `index.html` plus four additional HTML pages that the nav links to.
- Consistent Tailwind styling applied on every page (using the CDN or a compiled build).
- A short write-up (2–3 sentences per page) explaining your design choices inside HTML comments or in the README.

## Core Requirements
1. **Navigation**: Every page must contain the same Tailwind-styled `header`/`nav` with links to all five pages. Links should clearly indicate the current page.
2. **Structure**: Use a `header`, `main`, and `footer` on every page. Keep layout consistent but allow each page to feature unique content.
3. **Layout System**: Implement Tailwind `flex` or `grid` utilities (or both) to organize content sections on each page. Demonstrate at least one responsive breakpoint.
4. **New Semantic Tag**: Each page must showcase at least one semantic tag you have not used in class before (e.g. `figure`, `details`, `dialog`, `aside`, `mark`, `time`). Do not reuse the same “new” tag on multiple pages.
5. **Tailwind Components**: Build or adapt at least two reusable utility classes or components (e.g. buttons, cards, badges). Use them across pages for consistency.
6. **Media Content**: Include at least one image, embedded video, or audio element somewhere in the site. Use Tailwind utilities to style media responsively.
7. **Accessibility**: Provide meaningful alt text, ensure color contrast, and add `aria` or landmark attributes where helpful. Verify keyboard navigation works.
8. **Footer Content**: Every footer should include contact information or social links plus the last-updated date using the `<time>` element.
9. **Bonus Tailwind Feature**: Demonstrate one Tailwind plugin or advanced utility (dark mode toggle, aspect ratio, typography plugin, etc.). Document what you chose in a comment.

## Stretch Challenges (pick at least two)
- Add a “featured” carousel or gallery using Tailwind and minimal JavaScript.
- Create a simple contact form that validates required fields using HTML attributes only.
- Use the `<dialog>` element for a modal pop-up and style it with Tailwind.
- Implement a responsive CSS grid that changes the number of columns at three breakpoints.
- Add a multi-level navigation or dropdown that is accessible via keyboard.
- Incorporate a `table` paired with `<caption>` and scope attributes to display data cleanly.

## Submission Checklist
- All five HTML files are completed and linked together.
- Each page includes Tailwind via CDN and passes through an HTML validator without critical errors.
- Every requirement and at least two stretch challenges are checked off with inline comments referencing where they appear.
- README updated with any notes, credits for resources, and the stretch challenges you attempted.

Happy building—push your creativity, explore new HTML elements, and make sure the experience feels cohesive across all pages!
